# Important upcoming changes to Azure Security Center

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The information on this page relates to pre-release products or features, which may be substantially modified before they are commercially released, if ever. Microsoft makes no commitments or warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

On this page, you'll learn about changes that are planned for Security Center. It describes planned modifications to the product that might impact things like your secure score or workflows.

If you're looking for the latest release notes, you'll find them in the [What's new in Azure Security Center](release-notes.md).


## Planned changes

- [Two recommendations from "Apply system updates" security control being deprecated](#two-recommendations-from-apply-system-updates-security-control-being-deprecated)
- [Enhancements to SQL data classification recommendation](#enhancements-to-sql-data-classification-recommendation)
- [35 preview recommendations added to increase coverage of Azure Security Benchmark](#35-preview-recommendations-being-added-to-increase-coverage-of-azure-security-benchmark)


### Two recommendations from "Apply system updates" security control being deprecated 

**Estimated date for change:** February 2021

The following two recommendations are scheduled to be deprecated in February 2021:

- **Your machines should be restarted to apply system updates**. This might result in a slight impact on your secure score.
- **Monitoring agent should be installed on your machines**. This recommendation relates to on-premises machines only and some of its logic will be transfered to another recommendation, **Log Analytics agent health issues should be resolved on your machines**. This might result in a slight impact on your secure score.

We recommend checking your continuous export and workflow automation configurations to see whether these recommendations are included in them. Also, any dashboards or other monitoring tools that might be using them should be updated accordingly.

Learn more about these recommendations in the [security recommendations reference page](recommendations-reference.md).


### Enhancements to SQL data classification recommendation

**Estimated date for change:** Q2 2021

The current version of the recommendation **Sensitive data in your SQL databases should be classified** in the **Apply data classification** security control will be deprecated and replaced with a new version that's better aligned with Microsoft's data classification strategy. As a result:

- The recommendation will no longer affect your secure score
- The security control ("Apply data classification") will no longer affect your secure score
- The recommendation's ID will also change (currently b0df6f56-862d-4730-8597-38c0fd4ebd59)


### 35 preview recommendations being added to increase coverage of Azure Security Benchmark

**Estimated date for change:** January 2021

Azure Security Benchmark is the Microsoft-authored, Azure-specific set of guidelines for security and compliance best practices based on common compliance frameworks. [Learn more about Azure Security Benchmark](../security/benchmarks/introduction.md).

The following 35 preview recommendations will be added to Security Center to increase the coverage of this benchmark.

Preview recommendations don't render a resource unhealthy, and they aren't included in the calculations of your secure score. Remediate them wherever possible, so that when the preview period ends they'll contribute towards your score. Learn more about how to respond to these recommendations in [Remediate recommendations in Azure Security Center](security-center-remediate-recommendations.md).
